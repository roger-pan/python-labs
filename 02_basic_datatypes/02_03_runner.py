'''

If a runner runs 10 miles in 30 minutes and 30 seconds,
What is his/her average speed in kilometers per hour? (Tip: 1 mile = 1.6 km)

'''

# converting miles into kilometers
distance_km = 10 * 1.6

# converting seconds into hours
time_hours = 30.5 / (60)

# calculating average speed
avg_speed = distance_km / time_hours
